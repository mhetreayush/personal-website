      As I approach graduation, I&apos;m currently working as an Engineering Explorer (Intern) in the Founder&apos;s
      Office at <strong>Superjoin</strong>, where I&apos;m building a cutting-edge product with some of the most
      talented engineers in the field. My focus is on full stack web development, and I&apos;m continuously sharpening
      my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms. I also have a strong interest in system design and am deepening my
      knowledge of design patterns, architectures, and scalability to take on more complex challenges.
