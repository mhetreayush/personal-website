    <p>
      I am looking for a Software Developer Internships in a company/startup
      where I can learn and grow as a developer and contribute to the
      company&apos;s growth. My strong area is full stack web development and I
      am currently working on my Data Structures and Algorithms. But I am also
      interested in system design so I am continuously learning about different
      system design patterns, architectures and scalability.
